# Ux Exercise
By Felipe Christofoli

--

Quick note about the first item from **Nice To Haves**:

It is about this part "can be turned on/off by the user".

I didn't get it in which part of the layout I should have created this toggle functionality, so I created a toggle sidenav component instead (mobile only).

A second quick note is that I did the exercise with .sass extension just because I love the clean syntax.
